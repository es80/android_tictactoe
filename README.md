# Android Tic-Tac-Toe

[CodeUp Leeds](https://github.com/codeupleeds) ran an introduction to Android mobile app development in Kotlin [session](https://www.meetup.com/CodeUp-Leeds/events/dbcjtqyzgbxb/) and provided an almost complete two-player tic-tac-toe application. I've added some code to provide a mode for one-player against the computer. Many thanks to CodeUp Leeds.
